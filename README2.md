### Requirements
Your app must:

[ ] **Render a game in the browser**
[ ] **Include logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
[ ] **Include separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files**
[ ] Use **native Javascript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation**
[ ] Be **deployed publicly online**, where the rest of the world can access it (using a github pages project page or bitballoon)
[ ] Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
[ ] Include **custom styling** to convey the state of the game visually (and differentiate your project from any CSS libraries used)
[ ] Demonstrate attention to code quality with a **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** codebase that is **"clean" (well-indented, appropriately commented, organized)** and **readable.** Actually ask somebody else in the class to read your code and see if they can understand it!

### Deliverables
[ ] A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet.
[ ] A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
[ ] **A `readme.md` file** with a short description of the project, a list of which technologies you used for which parts of the app, an explanation of your approach (share some part of the code), and optionally a list of unsolved problems,  screenshots, etc.  See the [example readme](https://github.com/sf-wdi-labs/readme-example).
[ ] A **link to your hosted working game** in your game's Github repo.
